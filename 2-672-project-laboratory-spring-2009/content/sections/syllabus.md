Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Purpose
-------

This course will provide experience in formulating, solving, and presenting solutions to engineering problems.

Rules
-----

*   Students are to be in the laboratory only at assigned times, unless by special permission.
*   Attendance for the **entire** scheduled 3-hour laboratory session is mandatory — **absence will be reflected in your final grade**.
*   Written reports are to be written **independently** — while all of the reports in a group should be based on the same data, their text and figures must be created individually.
*   **Use of materials from course "bibles" or lab reports from previous terms or other groups is strictly prohibited**.
*   Written reports are due electronically on the class Web site **before** the start of class on the due date.
*   Each student may use up to a total of 48 hours of "grace" time for late reports without penalty; i.e. one report may be 48 hours late and the other on time, both reports may be 24 hours late, or anywhere in between. Reports turned in later than the grace time allows will be penalized at the discretion of the instructor.

Written Reports
---------------

It is anticipated that all written reports in a group will have data, calculations and figures which are similar, **but will have separately written texts**. If for any reason some figures, tables, appendices or other material are copied and shared among the group, such materials should be initialed by the person who prepared the original. We want each of you to have the experience that accompanies writing a report but do not expect you to have different experimental results when you've run the same experiment. In general, each report should have enough detail so that the reader can reproduce your results. (See [Section 3]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/reports): Guide to 2.672 Report Writing.) In the last week of the first experiment, one hour will be spent in a brief workshop on report writing.

Oral Reports
------------

The results from your final experiment will be presented in an oral presentation by your group collectively. Oral presentations are an important part of communicating your results, so it should be a valuable experience. (See [Section 4]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/reports): Guide to 2.672 Oral Presentations.)

Grading Policy
--------------

There will be 3 experiments. An independently written report by each student is required for the first two; an oral presentation by the group as a whole is required for the third experiment.

A letter grade (with pluses and minuses) will be given to each report. The final grade, however, is computed by assigning a number to each letter grade, and the following weighting is used.

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| 1st report (written) | 25% |
| 2nd report (written) | 25% |
| 3rd report (oral) | 25% |
| Lab performance (participation, knowledge of the subject etc.) | 25% 

To encourage using the laboratory as learning environment, substantial weighting is assigned to the lab performance which is **subjectively** graded. **It should be noted that much of this grade is based on the communication between you and your instructor in class**. You should use the interaction to demonstrate your knowledge of the subject matter.

**Late reports will be down graded.** The downgrading is progressive as a function of the days past due. The grade discount is at the discretion of the instructor who will be grading the reports.

For the first two written reports, the grading will be based half on technical content and half on how well do you communicate in writing.

Calendar
--------

The calendar table illustrates the number of sessions devoted to each lab, and the due dates. See the [labs]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/labs) section for detailed information about each lab. Each lab group completes three out of seven possible experiments in a semester. The experiments involve different branches of Mechanical Engineering knowledge, so we try to assign the students for maximum exposure to heat transfer, dynamics, thermo, fluid mechanics, etc.
